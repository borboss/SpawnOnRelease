# SpawnOnRelease v1.0

A mod for pixelmon, where releasing a pixelmon via the PC will spawn it in the world. I tried my best to maintain the stats of the pixelmon, however there may be some issues.
Works on Pixelmon REFORGED 8.1.2, have not tested any other versions.

## Does not support any commands that are used to release a pixelmon, it will be lost forever.


Drag & Drop to mods folder - Not tested on a server with more than 2-3 players on it at a time.
*you'll have to compile it, sorry
